 * 
 * <li>You should at least <b>create the following classes</b> in the package
 * <code>hillbillies.model</code>:
 * <ul>
 * <li>a class <code>Unit</code> for representing a Hillbilly Unit</li>
 * </ul>
 * You may, of course, add additional classes as you see fit.
 * 
 * <li>You should <b>create a class <code>Facade</code></b> that implements this
 * interface. This class should be placed <b>in the package
 * <code>hillbillies.part1.facade</code></b>.</li>
 * 
 * <li>The <b>header of that Facade class</b> should look as follows:<br>
 * <code>class Facade implements IFacade { ... }</code><br>

 * "http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/IandI/createinterface.html">

 *
 * <li>Your <code>Facade</code> class should offer a <b>default constructor</b>.
 * </li>
 * 
 * <li><b>Each method</b> defined in the interface <code>IFacade</code> must be
 * implemented by the class <code>Facade</code>. For example, the implementation
 * of <code>getCubePosition</code> should call one or more methods on the given
 * <code>unit</code> to retrieve its current cube coordinate.</li>
 * 
 * <li>Methods in this interface are <b>only allowed to throw exceptions of type

 * 
 * <li><b>ModelException should not be used anywhere outside of your Facade
