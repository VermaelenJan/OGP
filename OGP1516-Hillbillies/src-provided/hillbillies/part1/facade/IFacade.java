 * <ul>
 * <li>a class <code>Unit</code> for representing a Hillbilly Unit</li>
 * </ul>
 * You may, of course, add additional classes as you see fit.
 * 
 * <li>You should <b>create a class <code>Facade</code></b> that implements this

 * 
 * <li>The <b>header of that Facade class</b> should look as follows:<br>

 * 
 * <li><b>Each method</b> defined in the interface <code>IFacade</code> must be
