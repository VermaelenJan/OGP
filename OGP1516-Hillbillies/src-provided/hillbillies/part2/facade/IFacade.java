 * is provided to you stays in the <code>src-provided</code> folder. Only if you
 * modify the provided code, it's advised to move the modified code to the
 * <code>src</code> folder, so that your changes cannot be accidentally
 * overwritten by an updated version of the provided code.</li>
 * 
 * <li>You should at least <b>create the following classes</b> in the package
 * <code>hillbillies.model</code>:
 * <ul>
 * <li>a class {@link Unit} for representing a Hillbilly Unit</li>
 * <li>a class {@link World} for representing a Hillbilly World</li>
 * <li>a class {@link Faction} for representing a unit faction</li>
 * <li>a class {@link Boulder} for representing a boulder object</li>
 * <li>a class {@link Log} for representing a log object</li>
 * </ul>
 * You may, of course, add additional classes as you see fit.
 * 
 * <li>You should <b>create a class</b> {@link Facade} that implements this
 * interface. This class should be placed <b>in the package
 * <code>hillbillies.part2.facade</code></b> in your <code>src</code> folder.
 * </li>
 * 
 * <li>The <b>header of that {@link Facade} class</b> should look as follows:

 * <code>public class Facade implements IFacade { ... }</code><br>
 * Consult the <a href=
 * "http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/IandI/createinterface.html">
 * Java tutorial</a> for more information on interfaces, if necessary.</li>
 *
 * <li>Your <code>Facade</code> class should offer a <b>default constructor</b>.
 * </li>
 * 
 * <li><b>Each non-deprecated method</b> defined in this {@link IFacade}
 * interface and the interface from part 1 (
 * {@link hillbillies.part1.facade.IFacade}) must be implemented by your @{link
 * Facade} class. For example, the implementation of
 * {@link #getCubeCoordinate(Unit)} should call one or more methods on the given
 * <code>unit</code> to retrieve its current cube coordinate.</li>
 * 
 * <li>The methods {@link #advanceTime(Unit, double)} and {@link #work(Unit)}
 * from part 1 are <b>deprecated</b> and no longer need to be implemented.</li>
 * 
 * <li>Methods in this interface are <b>only allowed to throw exceptions of
 * type</b> {@link ModelException} (this class is provided). No other exception
 * types are allowed. This exception can only be thrown if (1) calling a method
 * of your <code>Unit</code> class with the given parameters would violate a
 * precondition, or (2) if the method of your <code>Unit</code> class throws an
 * exception (if so, wrap the exception in the {@link ModelException}).</li>
 * 
 * <li>{@link ModelException} should not be used anywhere outside of your
 * {@link Facade} implementation.</b></li>
 * 
 * <li>Your {@link Facade} implementation should <b>only contain trivial
 * code</b> (for example, calling a method, combining multiple return values
 * into an array, creating @Value instances, catching exceptions and wrapping it
 * in a ModelException). All non-trivial code should be placed in the other
 * classes that you create.</li>
 * 
 * <li>The rules described above and the documentation described below for each
 * method apply only to your {@link Facade} class. <b>Your other classes (e.g.,
